# Environment Setup
Before creating your own agent on Copilot Studio, itâ€™s important to structure and set up your environment on the Microsoft Power Platform, as this separates development from production. This distinction is fundamental to avoid unexpected issues in the production environment that could directly impact your end users.

# Login to Copilot Studio
Access the Copilot Studio website using a corporate or student account. It is essential to carefully review the available licenses.

# Create Your Agent
Based on the lessons, there are three main ways to structure your Copilot Agent:

1. Microsoft Copilot Studio provides a set of default agents specialized in specific topics, such as travel, financial insights, IT Helpdesk, and more. This can be quite useful if you want to quickly create an agent with specific knowledge.
2. The Copilot platform also allows you to create agents using your own Artificial Intelligence, which users can interact with directly and provide a precise description of the agent. For better results, it is recommended to use English, as Microsoft offers more resources in this language.
3. The final method is to create an agent from a blank model. This means the user will be responsible for defining all parameters during the creation process, providing information related to instructions and knowledge that should be used.
